The Thug Pigeon is a powerful, open source and free mailer service API, it provides you a dedicated service that runs in the a server sending the emails in the queue and a web service to you connect your applications with that.

The Thug Pigeon follows an [specification](SPECIFICATION.md) document based on a project that I developed inside the company that I work, originally called by [AwMailer](https://github.com/devsdmf/awmailer), this document describes the objective, features, components and everything that the project must have, this document is available in this repository and will be improved as the community needs, to be a great contribution to all developers.
